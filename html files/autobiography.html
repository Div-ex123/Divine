    <h2 style="font-family: sans-serif;">Who Is Mark Zuckerberg?</h2>
    <p> Mark Zuckerberg co-founded the <u><b>social-networking website Facebook</b></u>  out of his college dorm room at Harvard University.
    Zuckerberg left college after his sophomore year to concentrate on the site, the user base of which has grown to more
    than two billion people, making Zuckerberg a billionaire many times over. The birth of Facebook was portrayed in the
    2010 film <i>The Social Network</i>.</p>
    <h2 style="font-family: sans-serif;">Early Life</h2>
    <p>Zuckerberg was born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, New York, into a comfortable, well-educated family. He was raised
    in the nearby village of Dobbs Ferry.</p>
    <div>Zuckerberg’s father, Edward Zuckerberg, ran a dental practice attached to the family's home. His mother, Karen, worked
    as a psychiatrist before the birth of the couple's four children — Mark, Randi, Donna and Arielle.</div>
    <div>Zuckerberg developed an interest in computers at an early age; when he was about 12, he used Atari BASIC to create a
    messaging program he named "Zucknet." His father used the program in his dental office, so that the receptionist could
    inform him of a new patient without yelling across the room. The family also used Zucknet to communicate within the
    house.
    Together with his friends, he also created computer games just for fun. "I had a bunch of friends who were artists," he
    said. "They'd come over, draw stuff, and I'd build a game out of it."</div>
    <br>
      
        <!-- Education -->
        <h2 style="font-family: sans-serif;">Mark Zuckerberg's Education</h2>
        <p>To keep up with Zuckerberg's burgeoning interest in computers, his parents hired private computer tutor David Newman to
        come to the house once a week and work with Zuckerberg. Newman later told reporters that it was hard to stay ahead of
        the prodigy, who began taking graduate courses at nearby <u><b>Mercy College</b></u> around this same time.
    <div>
        Zuckerberg later studied at Phillips Exeter Academy, an exclusive preparatory school in New Hampshire. There he showed
        talent in fencing, becoming the captain of the school's team. He also excelled in literature, earning a diploma in
        classics.
        
        Yet Zuckerberg remained fascinated by computers and continued to work on developing new programs. While still in high
        school, he created an early version of the music software Pandora, which he called Synapse.
        
        Several companies—including AOL and Microsoft—expressed an interest in buying the software, and hiring the teenager
        before graduation. He declined the offers.
    </div></p>
    
    <h2 style="font-family: sans-serif;">Mark Zuckerberg’s College Experience</h2>
    <p>After graduating from Exeter in 2002, Zuckerberg enrolled at <u><b>Harvard University</b></u>. After his sophomore year, Zuckerberg
    dropped out of college to devote himself to his new company, Facebook, full time.
    
    By his sophomore year at the Ivy League institution, he had developed a reputation as the go-to software developer on
    campus. It was at that time that he built a program called CourseMatch, which helped students choose their classes based
    on the course selections of other users.
    
    He also invented Facemash, which compared the pictures of two students on campus and allowed users to vote on which one
    was more attractive. The program became wildly popular, but was later shut down by the school administration after it
    was deemed inappropriate.
    
    Based on the buzz of his previous projects, three of his fellow students—Divya Narendra, and twins Cameron and Tyler
    Winklevoss—sought him out to work on an idea for a social networking site they called Harvard Connection. This site was
    designed to use information from Harvard's student networks in order to create a dating site for the Harvard elite.
    
    Zuckerberg agreed to help with the project, but soon dropped out to work on his own social networking site, The
    Facebook.</p>
    
     <!-- short note on the facebook founding -->
    <h2 style="font-family: sans-serif;">Mark Zuckerberg’s and Founding Facebook</h2>
    <p>Zuckerberg and his friends Dustin Moskovitz, Chris Hughes and Eduardo Saverin created The Facebook, a site that allowed
    users to create their own profiles, upload photos, and communicate with other users. The group ran the site out of a
    dorm room at Harvard University until June 2004.
    
    That year Zuckerberg dropped out of college and moved the company to Palo Alto, California. By the end of 2004, Facebook
    had 1 million users.
    <div>In 2005, Zuckerberg's enterprise received a huge boost from the venture capital firm Accel Partners. Accel invested
    $12.7 million into the network, which at the time was open only to Ivy League students.</div>
    Zuckerberg's company then granted access to other colleges, high school and international schools, pushing the site's
    membership to more than 5.5 million users by December 2005. The site began attracting the interest of other companies
    that wanted to advertise with the popular social hub.</p>
    
    <h2 style="font-family: sans-serif;">Personal Wealth</h2>
    <p>The negative PR around the 2016 election and Cambridge Analytica scandal seemingly did little to slow the company's
    progress: Facebook saw its stock close at a record $203.23 on July 6, 2018. The surge bumped Zuckerberg past Berkshire
    Hathaway chief Warren Buffett to become the world's third-richest person, behind fellow tech titans <u><b>Jeff Bezos and Bill
    Gates.</b></u>
    
    Any gains were wiped out when Facebook shares dropped a staggering 19 percent on July 26, following an earnings report
    that revealed a failure to meet revenue expectations and slowing user growth. Nearly $16 billion of Zuckerberg's
    personal fortune was erased in one day.
    
    The stock rebounded, and Zuckerberg remains one of the world's wealthiest people. In 2019, Forbes ranked Zuckerberg at
    No. 8 on its ‘Billionaires’ list—behind <u><b>Microsoft founder Bill Gates</b></u> (No. 2) and ahead of <u><b>Google co-founders Larry Page</b></u>
    (No. 10) and Sergey Brin (No. 14). The magazine estimated his net worth to be about $62.3 billion at the time.</p>
    
                <!-- His Marital's Life -->
    <h2 style="font-family: sans-serif;">Mark Zuckerberg’s Wife</h2>
    <p>Zuckerberg has been married to Priscilla Chan, a Chinese-American medical student he met at Harvard, since 2012. The
    longtime couple tied the knot one day after Facebook’s IPO.
    
    About 100 people gathered at the couple's Palo Alto, California home for the ceremony. The guests thought they were
    there to celebrate Chan's graduation from medical school, but instead they witnessed Zuckerberg and Chan exchange vows.</p>
    
    <h2 style="font-family: sans-serif;">Mark Zuckerberg’s Daughters</h2>
    <p>
        Zuckerberg has two daughters, Max, born on November 30, 2015, and August, born on August 28, 2017.
        
        The couple announced they were expecting both of their children on Facebook. When Zuckerberg welcomed Max, he announced
        he would be taking two months of paternity leave to spend with his family.
